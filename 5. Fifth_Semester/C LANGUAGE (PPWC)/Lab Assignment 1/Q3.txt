Ques 3: Find the maximum value that can be stored in a float. Explain the reason behind it.

Answer: 

Maximum Value of float in C
Maximum Value: Approximately 3.4 × 10^38 (defined as FLT_MAX).
Reason: The float type in C uses the IEEE 754 standard, which allocates:
-> 1 bit for the sign
-> 8 bits for the exponent
-> 23 bits for the mantissa
This finite bit allocation limits the range of values that can be represented, resulting in the maximum value of about 3.4 × 10^38.
