Ques 1: What is the difference between a code and an executable file? Describe the steps used to convert a C
code to an executable file. (Write the necessary gcc command to show the working of the intermediate
steps).

Answer: Difference Between Code and Executable File
Code (Source Code): Human-readable instructions written in a programming language like C, typically stored in .c files. Computers can't directly execute this.
Executable File: Machine-readable binary file that can be directly run by the operating system (like .exe in Windows or a binary in Linux).

Steps to Convert C Code to Executable
1. Preprocessing: Preprocessor handles #include, #define, etc.
               Command: gcc -E program.c -o program.i
               Output: program.i (preprocessed file)

2. Compilation: Converts preprocessed code to assembly language.
             Command: gcc -S program.i -o program.s
             Output: program.s (assembly file)

3. Assembling: Assembler converts assembly to object code (machine-readable).
            Command: gcc -c program.s -o program.o
            Output: program.o (object file)

4. Linking:Linker combines object files and libraries to create an executable.
          Command: gcc program.o -o program
          Output: program (executable file)

Single-Step Command -> All steps combined: gcc program.c -o program
