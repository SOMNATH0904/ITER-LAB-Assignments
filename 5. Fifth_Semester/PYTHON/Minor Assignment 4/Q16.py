'''
Ques 16: Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter a list and displays whether the list is sorted or
not. Here is a sample run. Note that the first number in the input indicates the number of elements in
the list. This number is not part of the list. Here is the sample run:
Enter list: 8 10 1 5 16 61 9 11 1
The list is not sorted
Enter list: 10 1 1 3 4 4 5 7 9 11 21
The list is already sorted
'''

def is_sorted(lst):
    return lst == sorted(lst)

user_input = input("Enter list: ").split()

lst = [int(x) for x in user_input[1:]]

if is_sorted(lst):
    print("The list is already sorted")
else:
    print("The list is not sorted")
