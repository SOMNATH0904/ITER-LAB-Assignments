Ques 1. Which of the following statements is true about Python variables?
a. Variable names can start with a number.
b. Variables must be declared with their data types.
c. Python variables do not need to be declared before use.
d. Variable names can contain spaces.

Ans: c. Python variables do not need to be declared before use.

2. As a follow-up of Q. 1., which of the following is a correct variable name in Python?
a. 1variable b. variable 1 c. variable_1 d. variable 1

Ans: b. variable-1

3. Mention 2 ways by which you can apply comments in Python.

Ans: Two ways are ->
     1. Single Line Comment : # This is a single-line comment
     2. Multi-Line Comment : """ This is a 
                                  multi-line comment """

4. What is the difference between the 'input()' function and the 'print()' function in Python?

Ans: 1. input(): This function is used to take input from the user. It waits for the user to type something and then returns that input as a string.
        Example: name = input("Enter your name: ")
     2. print(): This function is used to output data to the console. It displays text or variables.
        Example: print("Hello, World!")

5. How do you convert the string '123' to an integer in Python?
a. str('123') b. int(123) c. int('123') d. float('123')

Ans: c. int('123')

6. Differentiate between the following operators:
a. = and == b. / and % c. / and // d. * and **
If there is no difference, then mention why, and if there is a difference, then justify with examples.

Ans: a. = vs ==
= (Assignment Operator): This operator assigns a value to a variable.
Example:
        x = 5  # Assigns the value 5 to the variable x
        print(x)  # Output: 5
== (Equality Comparison Operator): This operator compares two values and checks if they are equal. It returns True if they are equal and False otherwise.
Example:
        x = 5
        y = 5
        print(x == y)  # Output: True (because x is equal to y)

b. / vs %
/ (Division Operator): This operator divides the left operand by the right operand and returns the result as a floating-point number.
Example:
        result = 10 / 3
        print(result)  # Output: 3.3333... (division result as a float)
% (Modulus Operator): This operator returns the remainder of the division of the left operand by the right operand.
Example:
        remainder = 10 % 3
        print(remainder)  # Output: 1 (remainder of 10 divided by 3)

c. / vs //
/ (Division Operator): As mentioned earlier, it returns the result of the division as a floating-point number.
Example:
        result = 10 / 3
        print(result)  # Output: 3.3333... (float result)
// (Floor Division Operator): This operator divides the left operand by the right operand and returns the largest integer (or floor value) that is less than or equal to the result of the division.
Example:
        result = 10 // 3
        print(result)  # Output: 3 (floor value of 10 divided by 3)

d. * vs **
* (Multiplication Operator): This operator multiplies the left operand by the right operand.
Example:
        product = 4 * 3
        print(product)  # Output: 12
** (Exponentiation Operator): This operator raises the left operand to the power of the right operand.
Example:
        result = 2 ** 3
        print(result)  # Output: 8 (2 raised to the power of 3)
