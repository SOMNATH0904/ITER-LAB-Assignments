/*
A phone number can be thought of as having three parts: the area code, the exchange code and
the number.
Example: A phone number, such as (212) 767-8900, can be thought of as having three parts:
the area code (212), the exchange (767) and the number (8900).
Define a class Phone to store these three parts of a phone number separately as instance
variable (area_code, exchange, number). The class consists of two member methods: input ( )
and display ( ). Create two class objects of type phone. Initialize one directly (by using dot (.)
operator and instance variable with value area_code: 212, exchange: 767,
number: 8900), and initialize other from the user through member method input ( ). Display
both the numbers.
